## Your choice: What will the app look like?

Our app developers are still working on the app. However, we do already have a mock-up of what we think the app should look like. 

Here's an example of a view in the app. 

![Screenshot of application showing input and diabetes prediction.](../media/mock-up-app.png)

We expect the health-care practitioner to fill in the patient's medical data, then select the **Analyze** button to generate the prediction. After which the result will be presented as a *yes* or *no* answer with a probability. The probability is included to give the practitioner an idea of how likely it is that the result is correct.

## What else would you like to know?

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/02';">Where is the data currently stored?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/03';">Can I explore the data?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/04';">Did someone already train a model on this data?</button>
