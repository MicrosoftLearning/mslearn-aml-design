# Game: Design architecture

## Nice to meet you!

Hi! Welcome to Proseware. We've hired you as a machine learning engineer to help us create an app for our health care practitioners. The app will help the practitioners in diagnosing their patients more quickly. The data science team has created machine learning models by using medical data. The first model we want to integrate with the app is a diabetes classification model. 

Currently, the data scientists use their personal laptops for any machine learning workloads. We want them to work in Azure to more easily share code and use cloud compute for heavier workloads. We also don't want them to store data on their personal devices anymore but instead, work with data directly from an Azure storage solution.

## Which Azure service would you recommend to the data science team for machine learning workloads?

> [Azure Machine Learning](./Q1/01-aml.md)

> [Azure Databricks](./Q1/02-adb.md)

> [Azure Synapse Analytics](./Q1/03-synapse.md)

> [Azure Virtual Machine](./Q1/04-vm.md)
