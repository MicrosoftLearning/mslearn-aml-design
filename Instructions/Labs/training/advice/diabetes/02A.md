## That's correct!

Since we want a binary response from the model, it would be best to train a classification model. 

It's very important for us that the model is as accurate as possible. We want the model to be trained on our own data. 

Because of regulations in health care, we also need full control over how the model is trained. We're allowed to use algorithms from libraries such as scikit-learn but all our work must be defined in code. We prefer not using a UI but want to train models with scripts.

## How should we train the model?
