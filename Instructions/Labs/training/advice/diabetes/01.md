## Give advice on how to detect diabetes

Thank you for helping us decide on how to best train a model which can detect diabetes. 

At Proseware, we are developing an app which will help health care practitioners to faster diagnose diseases in patients. A doctor or nurse will be able to enter the patient's medical data in the app. The app will quickly analyze the data and should then tell the user whether the patient should get further examined for diabetes yes or no. 

To avoid confusion, we want the model to give a binary response: either the patient is likely to have diabetes or not. If a patient is predicted to have diabetes, more tests will be done to confirm the prediction. 

We already have collected data which is correlated with a patient having diabetes such as the number of pregnancies, the age, and BMI.

## What type of machine learning task is needed to predict diabetes?
