## Hmm...

What an odd question. Even though we just started investing in a data science team, we are thinking big and planning for scale. 

We want all of our solutions to be scalable. Even proof of concepts or pilots should be future-proof. What if a pilot is successful but we can't roll it out at a larger scale because we designed it wrong? 

Any compute heavy workloads should be done in the cloud and any data should be stored in a storage designed to store data. Even though there may be simpler alternatives like training locally or storing small datasets with in a code repository, we want to avoid these practices as they are not scalable.

You should have enough information to advise us now.
