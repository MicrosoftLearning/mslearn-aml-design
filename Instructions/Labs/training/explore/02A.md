## You chose: Tell me more about the team I'll work with.

We only just decided to work with machine learning models, so the current data science team is quite small. We therefore advise you to allocate your time wisely. 

It would be really helpful if you could work more closely together with the other two data scientists. You should be able to build on each other's work and easily share your code. Preferably, we would want to have a library of code snippets you could reuse for new projects to speed up the development process.
