## You chose: What do you want to use the models for?

We have some medical data stored for each patient which is stored in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database. The database allows us to export the data as a CSV or Excel file. 

A data analyst has a sample of that data stored as an Excel file on her local device. She has been exploring the data with Power BI. We have a Power BI report we can share with you to show you what the data looks like.

## What else would you like to know?
