## You chose: How many people are part of the data science team?

There are only two data scientists on the team. You'll be the third and hopefully give us guidance on how to work more efficiently. 

It would be really helpful if you could easily work together with the other two data scientists. You should be able to build on each other's work and easily share your code.

## What else would you like to know?

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='explore/04';">Do you already use the cloud for other data-related projects?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='training/explore/04';">I have no more questions.</button>
