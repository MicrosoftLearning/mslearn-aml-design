## Hmm...

Sounds like a question you should ask the data scientists. We don't really know what they do...

They work in isolation on their own device, which is something we want to avoid in the future. Having them work in Azure could potentially solve that issue.

## What else would you like to know?

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='training/explore/01B';">How many people are part of the data science team?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='explore/04';">Do you already use the cloud for other data-related projects?</button>
