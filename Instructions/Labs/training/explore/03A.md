## You chose: What tools do you currently use for machine learning projects?

We just started our data science team. So far, the data scientists seem to be working on their own devices. We haven't explored other options yet for them to work in the Azure cloud. 

Ideally, we do want them to work with a cloud service so that we can use more scalable and cost-efficient compute. Since we work a lot with medical and privacy-sensitive data, we also want to avoid people having a copy of the data on their own device.

## What else would you like to know?
