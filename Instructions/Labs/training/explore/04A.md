## Good question!

Our data engineers and data analysts are already working with Azure. One of the first large data-related projects we implemented was to create a data ingestion and transformation pipeline. The data engineers have mostly worked with Azure Synapse Analytics to create those pipelines.

Data is collected from multiple sources, like the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system we use for patient data. After collection, the data is cleaned, prepped, and saved to a SQL database. 

Finally, data analysts use Power BI on top of that SQL database to visualize necessary insights. They've created reports which are used by our customers on a daily basis.

You should have enough information to advise us now.
