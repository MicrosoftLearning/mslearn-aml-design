## Design a model training strategy 

You're about to start an interactive game in the form of a dialog. There are two parts to the dialog:

- **Get more information**: Learn to ask the most appropriate question to get more information about the case study.
- **Advise**: Use the gathered information to give advice on how to design a solution to the proposed problem. There are three scenarios to choose from. You can do as many scenarios as you'd like.

Each time, there will be **one optimal response**. You'll immediately get feedback to know whether you chose correctly.

## Case study

Imagine you've just been hired as a data scientist at a company called Proseware. Since you just started, you may first want to get to know more about your work by exploring.
