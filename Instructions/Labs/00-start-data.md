# Game: Design data ingestion strategy

## Nice to meet you!

Hi! Welcome to Proseware. We've hired you as a data scientist to help us machine learning models to support an app for our health care practitioners. The app will help the practitioners in diagnosing their patients more quickly. 

Currently, we have some medical data that we could use to predict whether a patient has diabetes. I assume you have some questions before you start...

## What would you like to know?

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/01';">What will the app look like?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/02';">Where is the data currently stored?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/03';">Can I explore the data?</button>

<button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='Q1/04';">Did someone already train a model on this</button>
