## Design a model training strategy 

You're about to start an interactive exercise in the form of a dialog. Each page will show three parts:

- **Introduction**: Some information is presented to introduce the question.
- **Get more information**: Learn to ask the most appropriate follow-up question to get more information about the case study. 
  *You'll only be allowed to ask one question (use one hint) before giving advice*.
- **Advise**: Use the gathered information to give advice on how to design a solution to the proposed problem. 
  Each time, there will be **one optimal response**. You'll immediately get feedback to know whether you chose correctly.

> **Note:**
> You won't get a score at the end of the game. If you want to track how well you do, count the stars you find. There are five stars to collect!
