## Give advice on how to ingest and serve the data

Thank you for helping us decide how best to extract, load, and transform the data we need to train a model.

At Proseware, we are developing an app that will help doctors diagnose diseases in patients faster. A doctor or nurse can enter the patient's medical data into the app. The app will quickly analyze the data and should then tell the user if the patient should be further screened for diabetes.

We have already collected data that correlates with diabetes, such as the number of pregnancies, age and BMI.

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Where is the data currently stored?</font></summary>
The original data is coming from our patient database. Since we work with privacy-sensitive data, the patient database is secured and protected so we're not allowed direct access to it. One of our data engineers has already extracted a small subset of the data for us which he has emailed to us.  
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Can I get a preview of the data?</font></summary>
Sure! The training data is currently stored as a CSV file. If we open the file the first few rows of data like this:
<code>
PatientID,Pregnancies,PlasmaGlucose,DiastolicBloodPressure,TricepsThickness,SerumInsulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigree,Age,Diabetic
1354778,0,171,80,34,23,43.50972593,1.213191354,21,0
1147438,8,92,93,47,36,21.24057571,0.158364981,23,0
1640031,7,115,47,52,35,41.51152348,0.079018568,23,0
1883350,9,103,78,25,304,29.58219193,1.282869847,43,1
</code>
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">How much data do you have?</font></summary>
We'll initially test the idea with a small anonymized dataset of 10000 rows. The medical data we work with is privacy-sensitive so initial development should happen on the small dataset instead of the actual production dataset which the data scientists should not get access to.
