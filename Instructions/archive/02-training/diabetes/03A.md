## Good advice!

Creating our own custom model using scikit-learn seems to fit with our requirements. It will take some extra effort and time from our data scientists, but hopefully it turns out to be worth it.

Since developing this model may take some effort, we want to ensure our data scientists can collaborate easily. Not only that, we also want this project to be an example for other projects. Perhaps there are parts of the work that can be shared and reused for other models.

Need to know more before you can give advice? Select a question below to find out more about the use case. **Remember you can only ask one question, so choose wisely!**


<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Do the data scientists already work with source control for their machine learning projects?</font></summary>
All we know is that the data scientists are working in Jupyter notebooks. To be honest, we don't really know what that means...
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Which programming language do the data scientists use?</font></summary>
The data scientists only work in Python. They work in Jupyter notebooks. They're not experienced with PySpark and we don't want them to invest time in learning a new language. We want to focus on quickly developing and deploying the model. 
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Do you use any other cloud services for data-related projects?</font></summary>
We work with Azure for some other data-related projects. Currently, we mostly focus on getting insights from operational data. We ingest and transform data with Azure Synapse Analytics. The transformed data is stored in an Azure SQL Database which serves a Power BI report.
