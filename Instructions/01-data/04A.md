## That's what we thought!

Azure Machine Learning sounds like a good fit for us at the moment. 

Data scientists can even use Jupyter notebooks with Azure Machine Learning compute, that's great!

Oh... There do seem to be quite a few options when it comes to compute within Azure Machine Learning.

<details>
<summary><font size="+1">How many data scientists do you want to dedicate to training the diabetes classification model?</font></summary>
Hmm... That's up to you? We have high expectations of the model as the stakes can be high. It needs to be accurate, have no bias, and be explainable. Who develops the model is not really our concern.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Did one of the data scientists already train the model?</font></summary>
No. The data scientists may have been exploring the anonymized dataset we provided to them but the model hasn't been trained yet. You'll need to start from scratch with development. Only when we have a model that performs up to our standards will we train it on production data in a separate development environment.

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Are the data scientists already working with virtual machines?</font></summary>
No. The data scientists are working on their own devices and are not using any cloud services.

Once you're ready to give advice, select the most optimal answer to the question below.

## Which compute would you recommend to train the model?
