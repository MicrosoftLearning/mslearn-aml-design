## That's correct!

As the data is stored as a CSV file and all rows have fixed columns, it's structured (or tabular) data.

The current data is an anonymized dataset. We want our design to be future-proof and therefore, we want to store the data in an Azure data storage solution. 

When the real data is stored in Azure, we can connect whatever tool we'll use to train the model to the storage and avoid having people send the data to each other per email. Especially as we'll be working with privacy-sensitive data, it'll ensure a safer way of connecting to (parts of) the data.

<summary class="button">In what format do the data scientists want the data?</font></summary>
Our data scientists are used to working with CSV files. They prefer working with CSVs because it allows them to read the data and the type of data as they'd like. Most of them have no experience with SQL.

<summary><font size="+1">Which programming language do the data scientists use?</font></summary>
The data scientists only work in Python. They work in Jupyter notebooks.

<summary><font size="+1">Which service will be used to train the model?</font></summary>
We're still debating, but it will be either Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, or Azure Machine Learning.
