## Good advice!

An Azure Data Lake will allow us to store the data as CSV files and make use of the hierarchical namespace to have more granular control over who has access to what.

So, we need to extract data from the patient database and load it into the Azure Data Lake.

Need to know more before you can give advice? Select a question below to find out more about the use case. **Remember you can only ask one question, so choose wisely!**


<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Which service will be used to train the model?</font></summary>
We're still debating, but it will be either Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, or Azure Machine Learning.
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Where is the data currently stored?</font></summary>
The original data is coming from our patient database. We are allowed to set up automated pipelines to the database through an API as long as only the pipelines are allowed to connect to the database. Since we work with privacy-sensitive data, data scientists are not allowed direct access to it.
</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1">Do you use any other cloud services for data-related projects?</font></summary>
We work with Azure for some other data-related projects. Currently, we mostly focus on getting insights from operational data. We ingest and transform data with Azure Synapse Analytics. The transformed data is stored in an Azure SQL Database which serves a Power BI report.
